# Employee Database

## Description
I created this application to increase my understanding of mySQL. I was able to use mySQL inside of the Inquirer package to create a CLI that allows the user to create and edit an employee database straight from the command line. It enhanced my understanding of JOINING tables in mySQL and I gained more knowledge on how databases function and interact with other applications.
